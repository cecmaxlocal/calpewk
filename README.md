Of course. Based on your provided keywords and project structure, here is a comprehensive `README.md` file for your `calpewk` project.

This template assumes `calpewk` is a monorepo containing different parts of your application (client, server, etc.). The use of "Yacc" strongly suggests the core of the project is related to parsing, compilers, interpreters, or domain-specific languages (DSLs).

Calpewk is a comprehensive platform for parsing, interpreting, and utilizing custom-defined languages. It leverages a powerful **Yacc**-based core to process language syntax, exposed through a suite of applications including a **Desktop App**, a **Web Client**, and backend **Servers**.

## 🌟 About The Project

The goal of Calpewk is to provide an end-to-end solution for working with custom languages. At its heart is a parser, built with **Yacc** (and likely **Lex/Flex**), which defines the grammar and structure of one or more languages.

This core parsing engine is consumed by a set of backend **servers** that expose the language processing capabilities via an API. Users can interact with this platform through two main frontends:
1.  A feature-rich **Desktop Application** for power users.
2.  A lightweight, accessible **Web Application** for broader access.

This project is ideal for creating tools for DSLs, configuration file validators, simple compilers, or any application that requires structured text input.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Core Parsing Engine**: Built with Yacc/Bison for robust and efficient language parsing.
-   **Client-Server Architecture**: Decouples the language processing backend from the user-facing clients.
-   **Desktop Application**: A cross-platform desktop client (e.g., built with Electron, Tauri, or Qt).
-   **Web Client**: A modern web interface (e.g., built with React, Vue, or Svelte).
-   **API-Driven**: Servers expose functionality through a well-defined REST or GraphQL API.
-   **Comprehensive Documentation**: The `doc` directory contains all necessary specifications and guides.

## 📂 Project Structure

The `calpewk` project is organized as a monorepo, with each major component in its own directory.

```

├── desktop/     # Source for the Desktop Application (e.g., Electron, Tauri)
├── doc/         # Project documentation, specifications, and guides
├── lang/        # Core Yacc/Bison grammar (.y) and Lex/Flex lexer (.l) files
├── servers/     # Backend server(s) source (e.g., Go, Node.js, Python)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your system.
*   **Git**: To clone the repository.
*   **Bison & Flex** (or Yacc/Lex): For building the core parser.
*   **[Node.js & npm]**: For the Web and Desktop clients. (e.g., `v18.x` or higher)
*   **[Go / Python / Rust]**: For the backend servers. (e.g., `Go v1.20+`)
*   **[C/C++ Compiler]**: Required by Yacc/Bison to compile the generated parser.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calpewk.git
    cd calpewk
    ```

2.  **Build the Parser:**
    *(This step might be part of the server build process)*
    ```sh
    cd lang
    make  # Assuming a Makefile exists to run bison and flex
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install Server Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd servers
    # Example for Go
    go mod tidy
    # Example for Node.js
    # npm install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Install Web Client Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd web
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

5.  **Install Desktop Client Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd desktop
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage

### Running the Servers

Navigate to the `servers` directory and run the main application.

```sh
cd servers/
# Example for Go
go run main.go
# Example for Node.js
# npm start
```
The API server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running the Desktop App

Navigate to the `desktop` directory and start the application.

```sh
cd desktop/
npm start
```

### Accessing the Web App

Navigate to the `web` directory and start the development server.

```sh
cd web/
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
