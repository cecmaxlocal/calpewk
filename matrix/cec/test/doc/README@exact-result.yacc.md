Excellent question. This expression combines standard mathematical functions with asymptotic notation from a system like Mathematica or SymPy. Let's break it down into two parts: the main expression and the Big O notation term.

### 1. Simplification of the Main Expression

The main part of your expression is:
`Cosh[x + y] + Cosh[x + y]/Exp[x + y]`

We can simplify this using the definitions of the hyperbolic cosine (`Cosh`) and the exponential function (`Exp`).

**Method 1: Factoring**

The most straightforward simplification is to factor out the common term `Cosh[x + y]`:
`Cosh[x + y] * (1 + 1/Exp[x + y])`

Since `1/Exp[z]` is the same as `Exp[-z]`, we can write this as:
`Cosh[x + y] * (1 + Exp[-(x + y)])`

This is a compact and simplified form.

**Method 2: Expanding into Exponentials**

For a more fundamental simplification, we can use the definition of `Cosh[z]`:
`Cosh[z] = (Exp[z] + Exp[-z]) / 2`

Let `z = x + y`. Substituting this into your expression:

1.  **First term:** `Cosh[x + y] = (Exp[x + y] + Exp[-(x + y)]) / 2`
2.  **Second term:** `Cosh[x + y] / Exp[x + y] = [(Exp[x + y] + Exp[-(x + y)]) / 2] / Exp[x + y]`

    Let's simplify the second term:
    `= (Exp[x + y] / (2 * Exp[x + y])) + (Exp[-(x + y)] / (2 * Exp[x + y]))`
    `= 1/2 + Exp[-(x + y) - (x + y)] / 2`
    `= 1/2 + Exp[-2(x + y)] / 2`

Now, add the simplified first and second terms together:
`= (Exp[x + y] + Exp[-(x + y)]) / 2   +   (1 + Exp[-2(x + y)]) / 2`
`= (1 + Exp[x + y] + Exp[-(x + y)] + Exp[-2(x + y)]) / 2`

This is the fully expanded form in terms of exponentials.

### 2. Analysis of the `O[x + y^x]` Term

The `O[...]` term is [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), which is used to describe the limiting behavior of a function, typically as an argument goes to zero or infinity. It represents the terms that are being ignored in a series expansion.

The expression `O[x + y^x]` is **mathematically ambiguous and syntactically unusual** for a few reasons:

*   **Ambiguous Limit:** Big O notation is meaningless without specifying the limit. Are we considering a limit as `x -> 0`, `y -> 0`, or some combination?
*   **Unusual Form:** Typically, the argument of `O` is a simple power like `O[x^n]` or `O[y^n]`. The form `O[x + y^x]` is problematic. In standard series expansions, if you have terms of different orders, you only keep the lowest-order (most significant) term. For example, `O[x + x^2]` as `x -> 0` would be simplified to just `O[x]`.
*   **Likely a Typo:** It is highly probable that this term is a typo or a misunderstanding of how Big O notation is used in series expansions.

#### What was likely intended?

Let's assume the expression came from a `Series` command in a language like Mathematica. Here are some plausible intended meanings:

*   **Possibility A: Expansion in `(x+y)`**
    If the expansion was in terms of the variable `z = x+y` around `z=0`, the term might have been intended as `O[(x+y)^n]` for some integer `n`. For example, `O[(x+y)^2]`.

*   **Possibility B: Multivariate expansion in `x` and `y`**
    If the expression was a Taylor series expansion around `(x, y) = (0, 0)`, the remainder term would represent all terms of a certain total degree or higher. For example, a first-order expansion would look like:
    `f(x,y) â‰ˆ f(0,0) + x*f_x(0,0) + y*f_y(0,0) + O(|(x,y)|^2)`
    The `O` term would contain all terms with `x^2`, `y^2`, `xy`, and higher powers.

### Summary

1.  **Simplified Expression:**
    The main part of the expression simplifies to either:
    *   `Cosh[x + y] * (1 + Exp[-(x + y)])` (factored form)
    *   `1/2 * (1 + Exp[x + y] + Exp[-(x + y)] + Exp[-2(x + y)])` (exponential form)

2.  **The `O[...]` term:**
    The term `O[x + y^x]` is ill-defined. It most likely represents a placeholder for higher-order terms from a series expansion where the notation was garbled. To interpret it correctly, one would need to know **which variable(s) the expansion is in** and **the point around which it is expanded** (e.g., `x -> 0`).

For example, the first-order Taylor expansion of your expression around `(x, y) = (0, 0)` is:
`2 - x - y + O(|(x,y)|^2)`
