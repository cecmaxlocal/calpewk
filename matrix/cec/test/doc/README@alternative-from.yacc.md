Of course. This expression is algebraically identical to the previous two you've asked about, just written in a different form. Let's break it down to prove this.

The full expression is:
`(E^(x + y) + E^(-x - y) * (1 + 2 * Cosh[x + y]) + 2 * O[x + y^x]) / 2`

We can split the fraction to analyze the main mathematical part and the Big O notation part separately.

`= (E^(x + y) + E^(-x - y) * (1 + 2 * Cosh[x + y])) / 2   +   (2 * O[x + y^x]) / 2`

### 1. Simplification of the Main Expression

Let's focus on the first term:
`(E^(x + y) + E^(-x - y) * (1 + 2 * Cosh[x + y])) / 2`

1.  **Use the definition of `Cosh[z]`**: Recall that `Cosh[z] = (E^z + E^-z) / 2`.
    Therefore, `2 * Cosh[x + y] = 2 * (E^(x + y) + E^-(x + y)) / 2 = E^(x + y) + E^-(x + y)`.

2.  **Substitute this back into the expression**:
    The part in the parentheses, `(1 + 2 * Cosh[x + y])`, becomes:
    `(1 + E^(x + y) + E^-(x + y))`

3.  **Now multiply by `E^(-x - y)`**:
    `E^(-x - y) * (1 + E^(x + y) + E^-(x + y))`
    Distribute the term:
    `= (E^(-x - y) * 1) + (E^(-x - y) * E^(x + y)) + (E^(-x - y) * E^-(x + y))`

4.  **Simplify the exponents** using the rule `E^a * E^b = E^(a+b)`:
    `= E^-(x + y) + E^(-x - y + x + y) + E^(-(x+y) - (x+y))`
    `= E^-(x + y) + E^0 + E^-2(x + y)`
    `= E^-(x + y) + 1 + E^-2(x + y)`

5.  **Substitute this result back into the full numerator**:
    The numerator is `E^(x + y) + [1 + E^-(x + y) + E^-2(x + y)]`.
    Rearranging gives: `1 + E^(x + y) + E^-(x + y) + E^-2(x + y)`.

6.  **Finally, re-apply the division by 2**:
    `1/2 * (1 + E^(x + y) + E^-(x + y) + E^-2(x + y))`

### 2. Simplification of the Big O Term

The second part of the expression is straightforward:
`(2 * O[x + y^x]) / 2 = O[x + y^x]`

As discussed previously, this term is mathematically ambiguous without knowing the limit point for the expansion (e.g., as `x -> 0`).

### Final Result and Conclusion

Putting both parts together, the simplified expression is:

**`1/2 * (1 + E^(x + y) + E^-(x + y) + E^-2(x + y)) + O[x + y^x]`**

This result is **identical** to the simplified forms of your previous two questions. This confirms that the following three expressions are all algebraically equivalent:

1.  `Cosh[x + y] + Cosh[x + y]/Exp[x + y]`
2.  `1/2 * (e^(x + y) + e^(-x - y) * (2 * cosh(x + y) + 1))`
3.  `(E^(x + y) + E^(-x - y) * (1 + 2 * Cosh[x + y])) / 2`
