' Computes the expression: O(y^x + x) + 1/2 * e^(-2x - 2y) + e^(-x - y)/2 + e^(x + y)/2 + 1/2

' Note: O(y^x + x) is not a standard mathematical function.
' If O() is a placeholder, replace it with the intended function.

x = 1.0
y = 2.0

' Compute the expression

' If you want to include y^x + x, uncomment below:
' result = result + (y ^ x + x)
